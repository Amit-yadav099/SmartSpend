## <a name="introduction">✨ Introduction</a>

Developed a modern AI-powered finance platform with secure authentication, real-time transaction management, smart budgeting, and event-driven automation using Next.js, Supabase, Prisma, ArcJet, Inngest, and Tailwind + Shadcn UI.

## <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** : A React-based framework for building full-stack web applications.

  -  Provides SSR (Server-Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation), and API routes, making it ideal for both frontend and backend.

  -  Handles routing, server functions, and API integration seamlessly.

- **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/dashboard/organizations)** : An open-source Firebase alternative.

  - Provides PostgreSQL database, authentication, storage, and real-time APIs out of the box.

  - Great for managing users, finance data, and secure storage without setting up your own backend.



- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** : A utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to build responsive and modern UIs quickly.

  - Instead of writing custom CSS, you use small utility classes like flex, p-4, bg-gray-200.

  - Helps create clean and consistent styling for the finance platform.

- **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)** : A next-generation ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for databases.

  - Works perfectly with Supabase’s PostgreSQL to provide type-safe database queries in JavaScript/TypeScript.

  - Makes working with data models and migrations simple and robust.

-  **[Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/)** : A tool for background jobs, workflows, and event-driven architecture.

   - Helps schedule recurring jobs (like finance data refresh, AI insights, or sending reports).

   - Runs independently of API requests, keeping the app fast and reliable.

- **[ArcJet](https://arcjet.com/)** : A security and compliance toolkit for modern apps.

  - Protects your platform from bots, fraud, abuse, and spam.

  - Important for financial platforms where data security and compliance are critical.


- **[Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** : A collection of beautifully styled, accessible UI components built with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI.

  - Provides production-ready components like modals, tables, dropdowns, and forms.

  - Ensures the platform looks modern and consistent without reinventing UI design.
